But rather than directly observing this event, LIGO detected Gravitational Waves, ripples in the fabric of spacetime given out by the motion of these dense and massive black holes. This is what the two LIGO detectors, one in Livingston, Louisiana, and the other in Hanford, Washington recorded on September 14, 2015.

Greetings! Say hello to this tutorial with a wave of your hand:

"""
You just made a wave! A wave is anything that moves back and forth, _oscillating_ in a periodic pattern as time goes by. We can make a chart of these oscillations with time, giving us a waveform of evenly spaced, alternating peaks and troughs. 


The peaks and troughs represent the extreme points of whatever is oscillating: your hand, water in a pond, or [....]

"""
The wave **amplitude** represents the height of the peaks and troughs, i.e. the extent through which you are moving your hand.

The wave **frequency** represents the number of peaks and troughs in a given amount of time, i.e. how vigorously you are moving your hand.

If you are excited, you probably have a large amplitude as well as frequency.

Finally, the wave **phase** is just a measure of what point you start off your wave: whether at the center, extreme left, extreme right, or somewhere in between!

All sound, whether music or noise, is waves created by vibrating air around us. The air above a drum vibrates when you strike it, and these vibrations travel as a wave through the air between the drum and your ear, shaking your eardrum at the same frequency and registering as sound in our brain.

You may hear the sound wave plotted above makes here.

 Listen carefully to the audio of the wave as you change the parameters.
What makes the audio sound louder? What makes it sound deeper?
Does changing the phase modify the sound?

"""
Waves are thus all around us - they make up the sound of music, and the cacophony of noise. But they do not typically look like the perfect, sinusoidal oscillations shown in the graphs above. 

Think of an ambulance siren. Its loudness varies, as does its frequency or pitch.
